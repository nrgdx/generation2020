# Generation Technology

## CCGT-H
A combined-cycle power plant uses both a gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50 percent more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power (www.ge.com).

A class H CCGT achieved a maximum 63.08% efficiency rating.

It normally takes 10 years of development to raise power plant efficiency levels by 1%.
